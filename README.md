# Zou for Docker

**Dockerfile for [Zou](https://zou.cg-wire.com/)**

### *For usage with Kitsu, please check the [Kitsu for Docker](https://github.com/EmberLightVFX/Kitsu-for-Docker) repo.*


# Info about this dockerfile

This dockerfile will automatically download Kitsu of the version mentioned in the .env file.
To update Kitsu to another version, simply modify the .env and run docker-compose up.
If you have set the .env to get the latest version you can simply restart the container and if there is a new version the container will download it for you.


# Getting Started

Check out the [docker-compose.yaml](docker-compose.yaml) file in the repo for the setup.

Modify the [.env](.env) file as needed for your setup.

Place the [db/pg_ctl.conf](db/pg_ctl.conf) at `./db/pg_ctl.conf` from your docker-compose.yaml location or modify the docker-compose to match the location.


# Usage

On first run the installation will download your wanted Zou version.
It will then initialize and populate the database and create a `initialized.txt` file in your previews folder. This is done to make sure the initializion is done only ones. Don't delete this file.
A default admin account will also be created:

- login: admin@example.com
- password: mysecretpassword


# Zou commands

If you need to run any specific zou commands, open the terminal of cgwire-zou-app and enter your command.
You can run `zou --help` to see all available commands.


# For development

This project isn't built for development of Kitsu and Zou.
For that I highly recommend Mathieu Bouzard's version that you can find here: [https://gitlab.com/mathbou/docker-cgwire/]
